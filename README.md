🔭 I’m a senior software developer with over 20 years experience. I enjoy writing in TypeScript, Go, HTML/CSS. 

I like to write open-source code, and co-founded the [kosmos project](https://kosmos.org) project, of which I primarily work on:
  - [sockethub](https://github.com/sockethub/sockethub)
  - [hyperchannel](https://github.com/67p/hyperchannel)

Other projects I maintain or co-maintain:
  - [remotestorage.js](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js)
  - [armadieto](https://github.com/remotestorage/armadietto)
  - [webfinger.js](https://github.com/silverbucket/webfinger.js)
  - [secure-store-redis](https://github.com/silverbucket/secure-store-redis)

For fun I'm working on a pirate-themed roguelike written in go. Still in early development.
